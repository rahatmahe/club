        <h2>Why  rahat?</h2>
            <p>The establishment of the "Rahat" Mental Health Community at MAHE
            Bengaluru aligns with our commitment to fostering a nurturing and supportive campus
            environment. We believe that prioritizing mental health is essential for the holistic
            development of our students. We hope for your endorsement and support in making this
            initiative a reality.
            Thank you for considering our proposal. We are looking forward to discussing this further
            and working collaboratively to enhance the mental well-being of our students.
        </p>
        <p>
        We at Rahat believe that everyoneâ€™s mental health matters.
        Rahat is a secure and accepting environment where people can openly share their vulnerabilities without fear of 
        judgment.
            We launched Rahat to ensure that everyone, regardless of their challenges, 
                knows they're never alone. Our goal is to create a safe and welcoming campus where we can all come together,
                have conversations, provide support, and assist one another
