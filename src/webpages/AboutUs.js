            <p>The establishment of the "Rahat" Mental Health Community at MAHE
            Bengaluru aligns with our commitment to fostering a nurturing and supportive campus
            environment. We believe that prioritizing mental health is essential for the holistic
            development of our students. We hope for your endorsement and support in making this
            initiative a reality.
            Thank you for considering our proposal. We are looking forward to discussing this further
            and working collaboratively to enhance the mental well-being of our students.
